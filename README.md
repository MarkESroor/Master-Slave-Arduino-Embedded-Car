# Master Slave Arduino Embedded Car
 
The main idea is to implement a micro-controller based carwith multiple safety and entertainment features,
and apply the scheduling techniques that raise the safety level to a maximum.
It includes an autonomous lane departure system to avoid sway while moving and
keeping the driving path to avoid collision; it corrects the path with the right speed
while alerting the driver. In addition, the current gear of the car is displayed and can
be changed using a joystick. Moreover, adaptive headlights safety is not just limited
to the driver but to those around him as well. The headlights are adjusted
according to the brightness surrounding the car, meaning that at night the
headlights will work with enough intensity to show the road but not high enough to
obstruct the vision of other drivers. Finally, the sound system, user can play any
mp3 file through the touchscreen. The mp3 file name will be displayed and the user
can Play/Pause and iterate between the saved mp3 files.
